Developed and modified a robot controller in C++ within the ARGoS swarm robotics
simulator to implement a reactive obstacle-avoidance strategy inspired by Braitenberg-
style control. Processed proximity sensor data to design vector-based motion fusion
and replaced discrete rotations with continuous velocity modulation for smooth
navigation. Strengthened understanding of perception-action loops, behavior-based
robotics, and simulation-based experimentation.
